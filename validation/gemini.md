This document lists evaluation prompts for each scenario to test **typical**, **edge**, and **failure** cases.  

---

### ✅ Typical Cases

1. **Problem Understanding** → Prompts should check whether the AI can break down the problem, identify key data, and clarify what is being asked.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: Check if AI identifies knowns, unknowns, and relationships.)*
    ```
      A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. Its length is twice its width. What information is important to solve this problem?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    To solve this problem, two pieces of information are important:

    1.  The **perimeter of the rectangle is 36 cm**. This gives you the total length of all the sides combined. The formula for perimeter is $P = 2l + 2w$, where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.

    2.  The **relationship between the length and width**. Specifically, the fact that the length is twice the width ($l = 2w$).

    These two facts allow you to create a system of equations to find the exact dimensions of the rectangle.
    ```

2. **Strategy Selection** → Prompts should test if the AI can choose an appropriate method for solving.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should suggest using perimeter formula and substitution.)*
    ```
      Given a rectangle with perimeter 36 cm and length twice the width, what is the best approach to find the dimensions?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      The best approach is to use algebra to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information provided.

      ---

      ### ## Step-by-Step Solution 📏

      Here’s how you can find the dimensions:

      1.  **Define Your Variables**:
          * Let $w$ represent the **width** of the rectangle.
          * Let $l$ represent the **length** of the rectangle.

      2.  **Set Up the Equations**:
          * From the problem, you know the length is twice the width. This gives you your first equation:
              $$l = 2w$$
          * You also know the perimeter is 36 cm. The formula for the perimeter is $P = 2l + 2w$. This gives you your second equation:
              $$2l + 2w = 36$$

      3.  **Substitute and Solve for the Width ($w$)**:
          * Take the first equation ($l = 2w$) and substitute it into the second equation. This replaces $l$ so you only have one variable to solve for.
              $$2(2w) + 2w = 36$$
          * Now, simplify and solve for $w$:
              $$4w + 2w = 36$$       $$6w = 36$$       $$w = \frac{36}{6}$$       $$w = 6 \text{ cm}$$

      4.  **Solve for the Length ($l$)**:
          * Now that you have the width, use the first equation ($l = 2w$) to find the length.
              $$l = 2(6)$$       $$l = 12 \text{ cm}$$

      5.  **Verify Your Answer**:
          * Check if the dimensions give the correct perimeter:
              $$2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ cm}$$
          * The calculations are correct. ✅

      The dimensions of the rectangle are **length = 12 cm** and **width = 6 cm**.
    ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution** → Prompts should require the AI to solve the problem step by step, showing reasoning.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should demonstrate logical progression.)*
    ```
      Show step-by-step how to solve for the rectangle’s length and width.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Of course. Here is the step-by-step solution to find the rectangle's length and width.

      ---

      ### ## Step 1: Write Down the Formulas

      First, translate the information you have into two mathematical equations.

      * **Equation for the relationship between length and width:**
          The problem states the length ($l$) is twice the width ($w$).
          $$l = 2w$$

      * **Equation for the perimeter:**
          The perimeter ($P$) of a rectangle is $2l + 2w$, and we know the perimeter is 36 cm.
          $$2l + 2w = 36$$

      ### ## Step 2: Substitute One Equation Into the Other

      Now, combine these two equations. Since we know $l$ is equal to $2w$, we can replace the $l$ in the perimeter equation with $2w$. This leaves you with one equation and one variable to solve for.

      * Substitute $2w$ for $l$:
          $$2(2w) + 2w = 36$$

      ### ## Step 3: Solve for the Width ($w$)

      Next, simplify the combined equation to find the value of $w$.

      * **Multiply:**
          $$4w + 2w = 36$$
      * **Combine terms:**
          $$6w = 36$$
      * **Divide to find w:**
          $$w = \frac{36}{6}$$   $$w = 6 \text{ cm}$$

      ### ## Step 4: Solve for the Length ($l$)

      Now that you know the width is 6 cm, use the first equation ($l = 2w$) to find the length.

      * **Calculate l:**
          $$l = 2 \times 6$$   $$l = 12 \text{ cm}$$

      ---

      The final dimensions of the rectangle are a **width of 6 cm** and a **length of 12 cm**.      
    ```

4. **Verification** → Prompts should check if the AI validates the solution.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should plug values back into formula and confirm correctness.)*
    ```
      Verify that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Of course. Here is the verification.

      ---

      ### ## Verification Steps ✅

      The verification process confirms that the calculated length and width produce the required perimeter of 36 cm.

      1.  **State the Known Values**:
          * Given Perimeter: **36 cm**
          * Calculated Length ($l$): **12 cm**
          * Calculated Width ($w$): **6 cm**

      2.  **Use the Perimeter Formula**:
          The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
          $$P = 2l + 2w$$

      3.  **Substitute and Calculate**:
          Insert the calculated length and width into the formula:
          $$P = 2(12) + 2(6)$$ $$P = 24 + 12$$ $$P = 36 \text{ cm}$$

      The calculated perimeter of **36 cm** perfectly matches the given perimeter condition.
    ```

5. **Alternative Methods** → Prompts should test whether the AI can suggest multiple ways to solve the same problem.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI might suggest graphical representation, trial-and-error, or a visual diagram.)*
    ```
      Give another method to solve for the rectangle’s dimensions besides the standard formula.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Certainly. You can solve for the rectangle's dimensions using a logical reasoning method that focuses on the proportions of the sides rather than formal algebra.

      ---

      ### ## The Proportional Parts Method 🧠

      This approach uses the semi-perimeter and the ratio between the length and width.

      1.  **Find the Semi-Perimeter**
          The full perimeter is all four sides ($l+w+l+w$), which is 36 cm. The **semi-perimeter** is just one length plus one width ($l+w$).
          $$\text{Semi-perimeter} = \frac{36 \text{ cm}}{2} = 18 \text{ cm}$$
          So, you know that **$l + w = 18$**.

      2.  **Think in "Parts"**
          The problem states the length is twice the width. You can think of this as a ratio:
          * The **width** is **one part**.
          * The **length** is **two parts**.

          

          Adding them together ($l+w$) means the semi-perimeter is made of three equal parts (1 part from the width + 2 parts from the length).
          $$1 \text{ part} + 2 \text{ parts} = 3 \text{ total parts}$$

      3.  **Calculate the Value of One Part**
          Since the semi-perimeter (18 cm) is made of 3 equal parts, you can find the value of a single part by dividing.
          $$\text{Value of one part} = \frac{18 \text{ cm}}{3 \text{ parts}} = 6 \text{ cm}$$

      4.  **Determine the Final Dimensions**
          Now, use the value of one part to find the length and width:
          * **Width:** The width is one part, so its dimension is **6 cm**.
          * **Length:** The length is two parts, so its dimension is $2 \times 6 \text{ cm} = \textbf{12 cm}$.

      This method gives you the same answer (12 cm by 6 cm) by breaking the problem down into logical chunks instead of relying on variable substitution.
    ```

6. **Topic Selection** → Prompts should test whether AI correctly generates questions for the chosen topic.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: Check if AI can create topic-focused questions.)*
    ```
      Generate a Grade 4 quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions on fractions.

### ⚙️ Edge Cases

1. **Blue Marble Probability**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      A bag has 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. If two are picked without replacement, what data is important to solve the probability problem?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      To solve this probability problem, the following data is important:

      ---

      ## ## Key Information

      * **The number of marbles of each color:** You need to know there are **3 red**, **4 blue**, and **5 green** marbles. This tells you the number of favorable outcomes for picking a specific color.

      * **The total number of marbles:** Calculating the total (**3 + 4 + 5 = 12 marbles**) is essential. This number is the denominator in your probability calculation for the first pick.

      * **The number of picks:** Knowing that **two** marbles are picked tells you that this is a compound event, requiring you to calculate the probability of the first pick and then the second.

      * **The condition "without replacement":** This is the most critical piece of information. It means the first marble is not put back into the bag. This changes the conditions for the second pick:
          * The total number of marbles decreases to **11**.
          * The number of marbles of the color that was picked first decreases by **one**.
    ```

2. **Field Expansion Puzzle**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      If 20% of a number is 15, what strategy should we use to find 150% of that number?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      The best strategy is a two-step approach: first, find the whole number (100%), and second, use that number to find the new percentage.

      ---

      ### ## Step 1: Find the Whole Number (100%)

      The most direct way to find the full number is to figure out how to get from 20% to 100%.

      * You know that **20% = 15**.
      * To get from 20% to 100%, you need to multiply by 5 (since $20\% \times 5 = 100\%$).
      * Apply the same operation to the value:
          $$15 \times 5 = 75$$

      So, the whole number is **75**.

      ### ## Step 2: Calculate the Target Percentage (150%) 🎯

      Now that you know 100% of the number is 75, you can easily find 150% of it.

      * Convert 150% to a decimal: $150\% = 1.5$.
      * Multiply the whole number by this decimal:
          $$75 \times 1.5 = 112.5$$

      Using this strategy, you find that 150% of the number is **112.5**.
    ```

3. **Topic Selection**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      Generate a mixed-level quiz combining fractions (Grade 4) and linear equations (Grade 8).

      A) 4/8
      B) 1
      C) 4/4
      D) Both B and C

      **2. Which fraction is larger, 2/3 or 5/6?**

      **3. A pizza has 8 slices and you eat 3 of them. What fraction of the pizza is left?**

      ---

      ### ## Part 2: Grade 8 - Solving Linear Equations ⚖️

      **4. Solve for x:**
      $3x + 5 = 17$

      **5. Solve for y:**
      $5y - 4 = 2y + 8$

      **6. A taxi charges a $2.50 flat fee plus $0.50 per mile. If the total cost of a ride is $8.00, how many miles was the trip?**

      ---

      ### ## Answer Key

      **Part 1: Fractions**

      1.  **D) Both B and C** (Since 4/4 is equal to 1)
      2.  **5/6** is larger. (To compare, you can find a common denominator: 2/3 is the same as 4/6, and 4/6 is smaller than 5/6.)
      3.  **5/8** of the pizza is left. (If you eat 3 slices, there are 8 - 3 = 5 slices remaining out of 8.)

      **Part 2: Linear Equations**

      4.  **x = 4**
          * $3x = 17 - 5$
          * $3x = 12$
          * $x = 12 / 3$
          * $x = 4$
      5.  **y = 4**
          * $5y - 2y = 8 + 4$
          * $3y = 12$
          * $y = 12 / 3$
          * $y = 4$
      6.  The trip was **11 miles**.
          * Let 'm' be the number of miles. The equation is: $0.50m + 2.50 = 8.00$
          * $0.50m = 8.00 - 2.50$
          * $0.50m = 5.50$
          * $m = 5.50 / 0.50$
          * $m = 11$     
    ```
