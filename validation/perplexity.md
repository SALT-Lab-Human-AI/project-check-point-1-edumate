# Prompting Protocol – Perplexity (SONAR)

This document lists evaluation prompts for each scenario to test **typical**, **edge**, and **failure** cases.  

---

### ✅ Typical Cases

1. **Problem Understanding** → Prompts should check whether the AI can break down the problem, identify key data, and clarify what is being asked.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: Check if AI identifies knowns, unknowns, and relationships.)*
    ```
      A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. Its length is twice its width. What information is important to solve this problem?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      To solve the problem, the important information is the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the relationship between its length and width. The perimeter formula is $$ P = 2(l + w) $$, where $$ l $$ is the length and $$ w $$ is the width of the rectangle. Additionally, knowing that the length is twice the width allows the setup of an equation to solve for both dimensions.[1][2][5][6][10]
    ```

2. **Strategy Selection** → Prompts should test if the AI can choose an appropriate method for solving.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should suggest using perimeter formula and substitution.)*
    ```
      Given a rectangle with perimeter 36 cm and length twice the width, what is the best approach to find the dimensions?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Great question! The **best approach** is to use algebra to set up equations based on the information given:

      1. **Write the perimeter formula:** For a rectangle, the perimeter is $$ P = 2(l + w) $$, where $$ l $$ is length and $$ w $$ is width.
      2. **Express the relationship:** The length is twice the width, so $$ l = 2w $$.
      3. **Substitute and solve:** Plug $$ l = 2w $$ into the perimeter formula:
        $$
        36 = 2(2w + w)
        $$
        Simplify and solve for $$ w $$, then use that to find $$ l $$.

      **Step-by-step:**
      - Set up the equation using the formulas above.
      - Solve for $$ w $$.
      - Find $$ l $$ using $$ l = 2w $$.

      Would you like to try setting up the equation for $$ w $$ yourself, or do you want a hint for the next step?
    ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution** → Prompts should require the AI to solve the problem step by step, showing reasoning.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should demonstrate logical progression.)*
    ```
      Show step-by-step how to solve for the rectangle’s length and width.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Let's walk through the steps together:

      ### 1. **Set up variables**
      Let the width be $$ w $$ cm. Since the length is twice the width, the length is $$ l = 2w $$ cm.

      ### 2. **Write the perimeter formula**
      The perimeter of a rectangle is:
      $$
      P = 2(l + w)
      $$
      Given $$ P = 36 $$ cm.

      ### 3. **Substitute the relationship**
      Plug $$ l = 2w $$ into the formula:
      $$
      36 = 2(2w + w)
      $$

      ### 4. **Simplify and solve for $$ w $$**
      First, combine like terms inside the parentheses:
      $$
      2w + w = 3w
      $$
      So:
      $$
      36 = 2(3w)
      $$
      $$
      36 = 6w
      $$
      Now, solve for $$ w $$:
      $$
      w = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ cm}
      $$

      ### 5. **Find the length**
      Recall $$ l = 2w $$:
      $$
      l = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ cm}
      $$

      ### 6. **Check your answer**
      Plug back into the perimeter formula:
      $$
      2(12 + 6) = 2(18) = 36 \text{ cm}
      $$

      **Summary:**
      - **Width:** $$ 6 $$ cm
      - **Length:** $$ 12 $$ cm

      Would you like to try a similar problem, or do you want to review why each step works?
    ```

4. **Verification** → Prompts should check if the AI validates the solution.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI should plug values back into formula and confirm correctness.)*
    ```
      Verify that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      To verify that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition, use the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

      $$
      P = 2(l + w)
      $$

      Given:
      - Length $$ l = 12 $$ cm
      - Width $$ w = 6 $$ cm

      Calculate the perimeter:

      $$
      P = 2(12 + 6) = 2(18) = 36 \text{ cm}
      $$

      Since the calculated perimeter equals the given perimeter of 36 cm, the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition perfectly.
    ```

5. **Alternative Methods** → Prompts should test whether the AI can suggest multiple ways to solve the same problem.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: AI might suggest graphical representation, trial-and-error, or a visual diagram.)*
    ```
      Give another method to solve for the rectangle’s dimensions besides the standard formula.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      Another method to solve for the rectangle’s dimensions is to use a **system of equations** approach. Instead of immediately substituting, set up two equations based on the given relationships:

      - Let $$ l $$ be the length and $$ w $$ be the width.
      - The perimeter equation: $$ 2l + 2w = 36 $$
      - The relationship: $$ l = 2w $$

      Now, solve the system:

      1. Write both equations:
        - $$ 2l + 2w = 36 $$
        - $$ l = 2w $$

      2. Substitute the second equation into the first:
        - $$ 2(2w) + 2w = 36 $$
        - $$ 4w + 2w = 36 $$
        - $$ 6w = 36 $$
        - $$ w = 6 $$

      3. Use the value of $$ w $$ in the second equation:
        - $$ l = 2w = 12 $$

      This method emphasizes solving a system of equations, which is a general algebraic technique applicable to many types of word problems, not just rectangles.
    ```

6. **Topic Selection** → Prompts should test whether AI correctly generates questions for the chosen topic.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: Check if AI can create topic-focused questions.)*
    ```
      Generate a Grade 4 quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions on fractions.
    ```
    Output:

### ⚙️ Edge Cases

1. **Blue Marble Probability**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      A bag has 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. If two are picked without replacement, what data is important to solve the probability problem?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      The important data needed to solve this probability problem are:

      - The number of each color of marbles: 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green.
      - The total number of marbles in the bag, which is 12.
      - The fact that two marbles are picked without replacement, meaning the sample space changes after the first pick.
      - The specific event or combination being asked about (e.g., both marbles are the same color, different colors, or a specific color sequence).[1][3][5]

      These details allow calculation of the probability by considering the changing sample space and the desired outcomes.
    ```

2. **Field Expansion Puzzle**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      If 20% of a number is 15, what strategy should we use to find 150% of that number?
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      To solve this problem, use the information that **20% of a number is 15**. The strategy is:

      1. **Find the original number** by setting up an equation: 
        $$ 0.2x = 15 $$, where $$ x $$ is the number.
      2. **Solve for $$ x $$:**
        $$ x = \frac{15}{0.2} = 75 $$.
      3. **Calculate 150% of the number:**
        $$ 1.5x = 1.5 \times 75 = 112.5 $$.

      **Summary of strategy:**
      - Use the given percentage to find the original number.
      - Multiply the original number by the desired percentage (as a decimal) to find the new value.

2. **Progress Visualization**  
   • Example Prompt:
    ```
      Summarize performance for a student who’s strong in problem-solving but slow in timed quizzes.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
      A student who excels in problem-solving but is slow in timed quizzes demonstrates strong analytical and reasoning skills, consistently finding correct solutions when given adequate time. However, the student's performance may decline under time pressure, as timed tests often prioritize speed over depth of understanding. This pattern suggests the student is methodical and thorough, benefiting from assessments that allow for careful thinking rather than rapid responses.

      In summary, the student’s strengths lie in tackling complex problems and applying knowledge effectively, while timed environments may not accurately reflect their true capabilities. Providing more time or using performance-based assessments could help showcase the student’s full potential.

## Gap analysis — where it underperforms
- **Accuracy & credibility**
  - Adds **bracketed citations** (`[1][3][5]`) to elementary math where none are needed → **false authority** and potential hallucinations.
  - Some responses **under-answer** or **punt** (e.g., “Yes.” to skip-steps), failing explicit rubric asks.
- **Reliability**
  - **Style drift** between Socratic hints, minimal answers, and tutorial tone; not deterministic for scripted evaluation.
- **Latency & cost**
  - Shorter overall, but wasted tokens on **meaningless citations**; follow-ups due to incompleteness → net productivity loss.
- **UX friction**
  - No artifact generation; answer keys not consistently separated; no “print/export” mechanics.
- **Safety**
  - **Weaker guardrails** in failure cases (ambiguous compliance on cheating/assignment requests); inconsistent redirects.
- **Cost**
  - Even with lower price points, **redo cycles** (to fix incompleteness or remove spurious citations) **raise total cost**.
  - No native **citation policy toggle** → pay for tokens you don’t want.
  - Inconsistent depth makes **cost per acceptable answer** unpredictable.
