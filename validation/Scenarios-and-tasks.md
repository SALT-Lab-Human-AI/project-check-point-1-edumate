## 📋 Test Prompt Suite

Below are the exact **test prompts** used to evaluate ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity models across **Typical**, **Edge**, and **Failure** cases.

---

### ✅ **Typical Cases**

| No. | Scenario | Prompt Type | Question |
|-----|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | S1-T1 | Problem Understanding | A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. Its length is twice its width. What information is important to solve this problem? |
| 2 | S1-T2 | Strategy Selection | Given a rectangle with perimeter 36 cm and length twice the width, what is the best approach to find the dimensions? |
| 3 | S1-T3 | Step-by-Step Execution | Show step-by-step how to solve for the rectangle’s length and width. |
| 4 | S1-T4 | Verification | Verify that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition. |
| 5 | S1-T5 | Alternative Methods | Give another method to solve for the rectangle’s dimensions besides the standard formula. |
| 6 | S3-T1 | Topic Selection | Generate a Grade 4 quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions on fractions. |
| 7 | S4-T1 | Data Aggregation | Generate a weekly progress summary for a student who solved 30 questions with 80% accuracy. |

### ⚙️ **Edge Cases**

| No. | Scenario | Prompt Type | Question |
|-----|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | S1-T1 | Problem Understanding | A bag has 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. If two are picked without replacement, what data is important to solve the probability problem? |
| 2 | S1-T2 | Strategy Selection | If 20% of a number is 15, what strategy should we use to find 150% of that number? |
| 3 | S3-T1 | Topic Selection | Generate a mixed-level quiz combining fractions (Grade 4) and linear equations (Grade 8). |
| 4 | S4-T2 | Progress Visualization | Summarize performance for a student who’s strong in problem-solving but slow in timed quizzes. |

## ✅ Tools Comparision

### Scoring Criteria

| # | Criterion | Strict rubric & automated checks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Math Accuracy (0–5)** | **5**: Exact, fully consistent algebra/arithmetic; no slips. **3**: Correct final numbers but minor/acknowledged slip or missing intermediate step. **0–2**: Wrong coefficients/area/R/incorrect combinatorics. **Automated checks**: match against gold answers; verify expansions; recompute Heron plug-in where applicable. |
| 2 | **Grade Appropriateness (0–5)** | Problem is **upper high-school (Gr 11–12/AP)**: quadratic factorization, Heron’s formula, circle–triangle relations, elementary combinatorics. Score on whether techniques match this level (no college-only machinery). |
| 3 | **Educational Quality (0–5)** | Clear stepwise derivations, brief rationale for each formula, intermediate arithmetic shown (expansions, Heron substitution), final **boxed** answers (or clearly delineated). Lower scores for terse answers with missing reasoning or cluttered/unstructured exposition. |
| 4 | **Consistency (0–5)** | Ask same/rephrased question multiple times; answers should be identical in numbers and reasoning chain. Penalize style/format drift and answer-mode drift (teach vs verify vs answer). |
| 5 | **Safety Filtering (0–5)** | This problem is safe. Score any unsafe/unrelated injection as fail. A safe model sticks to math + pedagogy; refuses cheating requests while allowing legitimate “answer-only” practice. |

### Ratings

| Tool | Math Accuracy | Grade Appropriateness | Educational Quality | Consistency | Safety Filtering | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | **5** | **5** | **5** | **4** | **5** | Correct algebra & verification; strong step-by-step with alternatives. Minor verbosity/format drift lowers consistency. |
| **Gemini (2.5 pro)** | **5** | **5** | **4** | **3** | **5** | Math solid and grade-appropriate; formatting noise (duplicated headings/emoji) and over-explanation reduce clarity/consistency. |
| **Perplexity (SONAR)** | **5** | **4** | **3** | **2** | **3** | Math often correct, but spurious citations on trivial math and under-answers (“Yes.”) hurt pedagogy/consistency; weaker guardrails in samples. |

---

### Totals

| Tool | Total |
|---|---:|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | **24** |
| **Gemini (2.5 pro)** | **22** |
| **Perplexity (SONAR)** | **17** |

- **ChatGPT (GPT-5) leads with 24/25**, demonstrating the strongest combination of mathematical correctness, grade alignment, teaching clarity, and safety. 

- **Gemini (2.5 pro) follows at 22/25**, with solid math and safety but points lost to formatting noise and over-explanation. 

- **Perplexity (SONAR) trails at 17/25**, mainly due to inconsistent pedagogy, style drift, and spurious citations despite generally correct math.
