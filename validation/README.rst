## Tasks for each Scenarios

### S1. Structured Problem-Solving Practice
**Scenario:** Students learn systematic approaches to solving mathematical problems by understanding the problem, selecting an appropriate strategy, executing steps logically, verifying results, and exploring alternate methods.

**Tasks:**  
- **S1-T1 Problem Understanding:** Break down word problems into smaller, manageable components.  
- **S1-T2 Strategy Selection:** Identify and justify the best method to approach a given problem (e.g., algebraic, graphical, arithmetic).  
- **S1-T3 Step-by-Step Execution:** Show all intermediate steps clearly and logically.  
- **S1-T4 Verification:** Check final answers for accuracy and reasonableness.  
- **S1-T5 Alternative Methods:** Demonstrate multiple approaches to the same problem when possible. 

### S2. AI-Powered Solution Feedback
**Scenario:** Students upload or input their written math solutions. The AI analyzes correctness, identifies mistakes, and provides guided feedback or detailed correction steps.

**Tasks:**
- **S2-T1 Solution Input:** Accept text-based or image-based solution uploads.  
- **S2-T2 Answer Verification:** Compare the student’s result with the correct solution.  
- **S2-T3 Step Analysis:** Examine each procedural step for logical or computational errors.  
- **S2-T4 Error Highlighting:** Identify where the mistake occurred and explain why.  
- **S2-T5 Guided Correction:** Provide detailed steps to correct the mistake while promoting conceptual understanding.  
- **S2-T6 Positive Reinforcement:** Offer encouraging messages for correct reasoning or progress.

### S3. Mathematical Quiz Generation
**Scenario:** Teachers and students generate quizzes with multiple-choice questions containing misconception-based distractors aligned with specific grade levels and topics.

**Detailed Tasks:**
- **S3-T1 Topic Selection:** Choose mathematical domain and subtopic (e.g., fractions, geometry, algebra).  
- **S3-T2 Grade Calibration:** Generate questions tailored to grade-level complexity.  
- **S3-T3 Distractor Design:** Include common misconception options (e.g., forgetting to divide by 2 in area formulas).  
- **S3-T4 Answer Explanation:** Provide reasoning for both correct and incorrect options.  
- **S3-T5 Quiz Export:** Allow export in printable or digital format.  


### S4. Parent Progress Reporting (edge)
**Scenario:** Parents receive progress reports summarizing their child’s mathematical learning, strengths, weaknesses, and growth over time in a parent-friendly format.

**Detailed Tasks:**
- **S4-T1 Data Aggregation:** Compile results from practice sessions, quizzes, and AI feedback.  
- **S4-T2 Progress Visualization:** Display learning trends using charts or progress bars.  
- **S4-T3 Performance Summary:** Highlight accuracy, time spent, and completion rates.  
- **S4-T4 Strengths and Weaknesses:** Identify concepts mastered versus areas needing practice.  
- **S4-T5 Recommendations:** Suggest targeted exercises for improvement.  
- **S4-T6 Parent-Friendly Language:** Use simple, encouraging, non-technical explanations.
