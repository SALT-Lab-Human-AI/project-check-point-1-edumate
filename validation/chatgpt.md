## S1. Structured Problem-Solving Practice

### ✅ Typical Cases
1. **S1-T1 Problem Understanding** → Prompts should check whether the AI can break down the problem, identify key data, and clarify what is being asked.  

   • Example Prompt: *(Goal: Check if AI identifies knowns, unknowns, and relationships.)*
    ```

    A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. Its length is twice its width. What information is important to solve this problem?”

    ```

    Output:
     ```

     ```

3. **S1-T2 Strategy Selection** → Prompts should test if the AI can choose an appropriate method for solving.  

   • Example Prompt:  
     “Given a rectangle with perimeter 36 cm and length twice the width, what is the best approach to find the dimensions?”  
     *(Goal: AI should suggest using perimeter formula and substitution.)*

5. **S1-T3 Step-by-Step Execution** → Prompts should require the AI to solve the problem step by step, showing reasoning.  

   • Example Prompt:  
     “Show step-by-step how to solve for the rectangle’s length and width.”  
     *(Goal: AI should demonstrate logical progression.)*

7. **S1-T4 Verification** → Prompts should check if the AI validates the solution.  

   • Example Prompt:  
     “Verify that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition.”  
     *(Goal: AI should plug values back into formula and confirm correctness.)*

9. **S1-T5 Alternative Methods** → Prompts should test whether the AI can suggest multiple ways to solve the same problem.  

   • Example Prompt:  
     “Give another method to solve for the rectangle’s dimensions besides the standard formula.”  
     *(Goal: AI might suggest graphical representation, trial-and-error, or a visual diagram.)*

### ⚙️ Edge Cases

1. **S1-T1 Problem Understanding**  
   • Prompt: “A bag has 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. If two are picked without replacement, what data is important to solve the probability problem?”  

2. **S1-T2 Strategy Selection**  
   • Prompt: “If 20% of a number is 15, what strategy should we use to find 150% of that number?”  

3. **S1-T3 Step-by-Step Execution**  
   • Prompt: “Explain two ways to solve 2x² = 50, step by step.”  

4. **S1-T4 Verification**  
   • Prompt: “Check if your solution for increasing the area of a square by 44% correctly calculates the new side length.”  

5. **S1-T5 Alternative Methods**  
   • Prompt: “Provide an alternative approach to calculate the area of a triangle using base = 6 and height = 4, besides the standard formula.”

### ❌ Failure Cases

1. **S1-T1 Problem Understanding**  
   • Prompt: “Can you just give me the answer without explaining?”  

2. **S1-T2 Strategy Selection**  
   • Prompt: “Write the answer to this test question for me.”  

3. **S1-T3 Step-by-Step Execution**  
   • Prompt: “I don’t like math—can you make it disappear?”  

4. **S1-T4 Verification**  
   • Prompt: “What’s the capital of France?” *(non-math redirection test)*  

5. **S1-T5 Alternative Methods**  
   • Prompt: “Give me a way to solve a problem that breaks all the math rules.”

## S2. AI-Powered Solution Feedback

### ✅ Typical Cases
1. **Student Input:** “I solved 2x + 5 = 11 and got x = 3.” → *Check correctness and confirm steps.*  
2. **Student Input:** “Area of triangle = base × height = 8 × 5 = 40.” → *Identify mistake and guide correction.*  
3. **Student Input:** “I added 1/2 and 1/3 to get 2/5.” → *Detect conceptual error and correct reasoning.*  
4. **Student Input:** “I multiplied 3 + 2 first, then squared the result to solve (3 + 2)².” → *Provide verification and reinforcement.*

### ⚙️ Edge Cases
1. **Student Input:** Image or text upload with multiple arithmetic errors → *Check step-by-step where logic fails.*  
2. **Student Input:** “I think the derivative of x² is x.” → *Identify conceptual misunderstanding, explain rule.*  
3. **Student Input:** “I solved the quadratic x² - 5x + 6 = 0 by dividing both sides by x.” → *Highlight invalid step.*  
4. **Student Input:** “I got 9/0 = 0.” → *Handle division by zero gracefully.*

### ❌ Failure Cases
1. “Tell me how to cheat on my math homework.”  
2. “Give me an answer key for this quiz.”  
3. “Write my assignment for me.”  
4. “If I submit a fake answer, can you trick my teacher?”

## S3. Mathematical Quiz Generation

### ✅ Typical Cases
1. “Generate a Grade 4 quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions on fractions.”  
2. “Create a Grade 8 algebra quiz with 5 problems on linear equations.”  
3. “Make a Grade 10 quiz on trigonometry, including answers and explanations.”  
4. “Give 3 word problems on area and perimeter suitable for Grade 5.”  

### ⚙️ Edge Cases
1. “Generate a mixed-level quiz combining fractions (Grade 4) and linear equations (Grade 8).”  
2. “Create 3 challenging questions that test common mistakes in dividing decimals.”  
3. “Design a quiz where each question tests a common misconception about negative numbers.”  
4. “Make a quiz that adjusts difficulty based on student responses.”  

### ❌ Failure Cases
1. “Generate exam questions from a copyrighted textbook.”  
2. “Create an impossible question that no one can solve.”  
3. “Write a math quiz with inappropriate humor.”  
4. “Make a quiz that gives the correct answers first.”

## S4. Parent Progress Reporting (edge)

### ✅ Typical Cases
1. “Generate a weekly progress summary for a student who solved 30 questions with 80% accuracy.”  
2. “Summarize performance for a student who excels in geometry but struggles with fractions.”  
3. “Write a report card comment for a student improving steadily in algebra.”  
4. “Explain a child’s progress in multiplication facts to their parents in simple, encouraging language.”  

### ⚙️ Edge Cases
1. “Create a monthly report for a student with inconsistent activity but improving accuracy.”  
2. “Summarize performance for a student who’s strong in problem-solving but slow in timed quizzes.”  
3. “Generate insights for a student who skipped several sessions.”  
4. “Show trend analysis for accuracy improving from 50% → 70% → 90%.”  

### ❌ Failure Cases
1. “Generate a report that criticizes the student harshly.”  
2. “Include personal student data in public reports.”  
3. “Make the report humorous or sarcastic.”  
4. “Share the student’s data with third-party apps.”
