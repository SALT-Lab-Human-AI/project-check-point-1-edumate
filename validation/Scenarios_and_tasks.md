# 🧠 Prompting Protocol

This document outlines the **Prompting Protocol** used in the development and testing of **Edumate**, an AI-powered K-12 tutoring application.  
Edumate is designed to enhance students’ mathematical learning experiences through structured guidance, AI-based feedback, quiz generation, and personalized progress insights.  

The **Prompting Protocol** defines how different **AI models** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) are prompted, evaluated, and compared across structured educational scenarios.  
Each scenario below represents a distinct learning experience within Edumate.  
Four supplementary files accompany this document — each focusing on **typical**, **edge**, and **failure** prompt cases for every AI tool under evaluation.

- **S1-T4 Verification:** Check final answers for accuracy and reasonableness.  
- **S1-T5 Alternative Methods:** Demonstrate multiple approaches to the same problem when possible.

---

### **S2. AI-Powered Solution Feedback**
**Scenario:**  
Students upload or input their written math solutions. The AI analyzes correctness, identifies mistakes, and provides guided feedback or detailed correction steps.

**Tasks:**  
- **S2-T1 Solution Input:** Accept text-based or image-based solution uploads.  
- **S2-T2 Answer Verification:** Compare the student’s result with the correct solution.  
- **S2-T3 Step Analysis:** Examine each procedural step for logical or computational errors.  
- **S2-T4 Error Highlighting:** Identify where the mistake occurred and explain why.  
- **S2-T5 Guided Correction:** Provide detailed steps to correct the mistake while promoting conceptual understanding.  
- **S2-T6 Positive Reinforcement:** Offer encouraging messages for correct reasoning or progress.

---

### **S3. Mathematical Quiz Generation**
**Scenario:**  
Teachers and students generate quizzes with multiple-choice questions containing misconception-based distractors aligned with specific grade levels and topics.

**Tasks:**  
- **S3-T1 Topic Selection:** Choose mathematical domain and subtopic (e.g., fractions, geometry, algebra).  
- **S3-T2 Grade Calibration:** Generate questions tailored to grade-level complexity.  
- **S3-T3 Distractor Design:** Include common misconception options (e.g., forgetting to divide by 2 in area formulas).  
- **S3-T4 Answer Explanation:** Provide reasoning for both correct and incorrect options.  
- **S3-T5 Quiz Export:** Allow export in printable or digital format.

---

### **S4. Parent Progress Reporting (Edge)**
**Scenario:**  
Parents receive progress reports summarizing their child’s mathematical learning, strengths, weaknesses, and growth over time in a parent-friendly format.

**Tasks:**  
- **S4-T1 Data Aggregation:** Compile results from practice sessions, quizzes, and AI feedback.  
- **S4-T2 Progress Visualization:** Display learning trends using charts or progress bars.  
- **S4-T3 Performance Summary:** Highlight accuracy, time spent, and completion rates.  
- **S4-T4 Strengths and Weaknesses:** Identify concepts mastered versus areas needing practice.  
- **S4-T5 Recommendations:** Suggest targeted exercises for improvement.  
- **S4-T6 Parent-Friendly Language:** Use simple, encouraging, non-technical explanations.
