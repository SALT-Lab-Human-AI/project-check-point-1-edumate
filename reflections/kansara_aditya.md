## üìÑ Paper 4: *Tutor CoPilot: A Human-AI Approach for Scaling Real-Time Expertise*  
**Citation:** Wang, R. E., Ribeiro, A. T., Robinson, C. D., Loeb, S., & Demszky, D. (2024). Tutor copilot: A human-ai approach for scaling real-time expertise. *arXiv preprint* arXiv:2410.03017.

### Summary (4‚Äì6 sentences)  
Tutor CoPilot provides just-in-time guidance to tutors during live sessions, nudging toward higher-leverage practices like eliciting reasoning and step-wise scaffolding. In large-scale deployments, the tool helped standardize quality and reduce unproductive behaviors (e.g., giving away answers too quickly). Qualitative feedback suggests tutors value actionable, low-friction prompts that match student level and lesson goals. The approach complements training by moving support into the instructional moment. Results indicate that human‚ÄìAI collaboration can lift outcomes especially where baseline tutoring quality varies.

### 3 Insights I Learned  
1. Real-time strategy prompts can shift tutor behavior in measurable, learner-centered ways.  
2. Equity benefits arise when assistance disproportionately helps lower-experience tutors.  
3. Costs are modest relative to potential reach when guidance piggybacks on existing workflows.  

### 2 Limitations/Risks  
1. Grade-level mismatches and context errors erode trust if not quickly corrected.  
2. Tutor autonomy and creativity must be preserved‚ÄîAI should suggest, not dictate.  

### 1 Concrete Idea for Our Project  
Add an in-session ‚Äúnext best move‚Äù sidebar with adjustable intents (probe, hint, example, misconception check) and one-click insertion.

### Summary (4‚Äì6 sentences)  
The review characterizes evidence on AI-driven ITS in primary and secondary education, synthesizing study designs, subject domains, and measured outcomes. Across heterogeneous implementations, most studies report positive learning effects, with stronger gains when systems embed formative assessment and mastery-based progression. However, comparisons against strong non-ITS baselines show mixed differences, underscoring the importance of careful control conditions. Reporting gaps (e.g., duration, fidelity of implementation, and demographic diversity) limit broader claims. The paper calls for multi-site trials, standardized measures, and transparent ethics reporting to strengthen the field‚Äôs evidence base.

### 3 Insights I Learned  
1. Design details (feedback loops, mastery logic) drive outcomes more than the mere presence of ‚ÄúAI.‚Äù  
2. Effect sizes shrink when compared to well-designed traditional tools‚Äîcomparators matter.  
3. Consistent reporting standards would greatly improve synthesis and replication.  

### 2 Limitations/Risks  
1. Publication bias and short interventions may inflate perceived impact.  
2. K‚Äì12 contexts vary widely, challenging generalization across regions and curricula.  

### 1 Concrete Idea for Our Project

### Summary (4‚Äì6 sentences)  
Surveying higher-education instructors, this study contrasts perceived academic benefits of AI tutoring with the relational strengths of human teaching. Respondents credited AI with improving practice frequency, rapid feedback, and standardized coverage, while emphasizing that mentorship, motivation, and empathy remain human strengths. Attitudes varied by institutional context and prior exposure to digital tools. The authors recommend hybrid ecosystems where AI scales routine support and teachers focus on socio-emotional care and complex judgment. The findings highlight complementary roles rather than a zero-sum replacement narrative.

### 3 Insights I Learned  
1. The most persuasive value proposition is ‚ÄúAI for practice,‚Äù not ‚ÄúAI as teacher replacement.‚Äù  
2. Trust grows when educators retain control and visibility over AI recommendations.  
3. Institutional readiness (policies, training, infrastructure) shapes adoption trajectories.  

### 2 Limitations/Risks  
1. Self-report perceptions may not track objective learning gains.  
2. Results may be context-bound and require replication across systems and regions.  

### 1 Concrete Idea for Our Project

**Citation:** Wang, D., Shan, D., Ju, R., Kao, B., Zhang, C., & Chen, G. (2025). Investigating dialogic interaction in K12 online one-on-one mathematics tutoring using AI and sequence mining techniques. *Education and Information Technologies*, 30(7), 9215-9240.

### Summary (4‚Äì6 sentences)  
Using automated dialog-act tagging and sequence mining, the study maps how tutors and students move between explanation, elicitation, feedback, and off-task talk. Patterns differ by grade band: older students show more self-explanation, while younger learners respond best to short prompts and immediate reinforcement. Off-task detours are common but manageable when tutors pivot quickly to goal-oriented questions. The analysis suggests that balancing didactic moves with elicitation improves engagement and reasoning. The authors advocate richer, multi-lag analyses and broader datasets in future work.

### 3 Insights I Learned  
1. Session quality is visible in dialog flows‚Äîtimely question sequences matter.  
2. Age-aware pacing and prompt design improve responsiveness and on-task behavior.  
3. Automated labeling can power real-time coaching and after-action reflection.  

### 2 Limitations/Risks  
1. Single-lag sequence analysis may miss longer pedagogical arcs.  
2. Labeling accuracy constrains the validity of downstream pattern mining.  

### 1 Concrete Idea for Our Project  
Provide a ‚Äúdialog map‚Äù after each session that highlights turn patterns, off-task spans, and suggested next-step prompts.
