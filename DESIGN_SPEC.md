### üß© S1 Structured Problem-Solving Practice

**Purpose:**  
Guide students step-by-step through the full problem-solving cycle‚Äîfrom understanding and planning to execution, verification, and exploring alternate strategies.

**Workflow:**
1. **Select Grade:** Slider (1‚Äì12) or dropdown to set grade level.  
2. **Select Topic:** Dropdown auto-filtered by grade (Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, etc.).  
3. **Enter or Generate Question:**  
   - **Option A:** Type a custom problem.  
   - **Option B:** Click **‚ÄúGenerate a Question‚Äù** for an AI-generated example.  
4. **Submit:** Student clicks **‚ÄúStart Practice‚Äù**.  
5. **AI Response:** **Detailed, multi-phase solution** showing:  
   - Understanding the problem  
   - Planning strategy  
   - Step-by-step solution with LaTeX math  
   - Verification and alternate approaches
