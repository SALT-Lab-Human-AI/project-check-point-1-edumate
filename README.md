## 🆘 Problem Statement and Why It Matters
Students need **instant, reliable, grade-level help** outside class. Generic chatbots hallucinate and aren’t aligned to standards; parents rarely see **which skills improved** and **where their child struggles**.  
**EduMate** is a **RAG-grounded** tutor + quiz system that:
- explains **with LaTeX and examples**,
- generates **curriculum-aligned quizzes** with **auto-grading + rationales**, and
- provides a **Parent Dashboard** with **trends, gaps, and recommendations**.

## 🚀 Initial Concept and Value Proposition

EduMate is a next-generation AI-driven tutoring platform designed to bridge the growing gap in K–12 education by combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent orchestration, and student progress tracking. Unlike generic AI assistants that provide quick answers, EduMate is built around pedagogical depth: guiding students through concepts, verifying correctness, and ensuring lasting comprehension.

At its heart lies an Orchestrator Agent that dynamically routes user input into two learning pathways:

**Tutor Bot** – Interactive, conversational help where students can ask questions and receive step-by-step Socratic guidance.

**Quiz Module** – Automatically generated, adaptive quizzes tailored to the student’s grade level, difficulty preferences, and learning history.

Both pathways feed into a RAG pipeline that ensures reliable, curriculum-aligned answers by combining large language models (LLMs) with a structured K–12 knowledge base stored in ChromaDB.

### 🔑 Key Value Propositions:
1. **Personalized AI Tutoring**  
   - Uses retrieval from **K–12 ChromaDB knowledge base**.  
   - Answers are step-based, with explanations instead of shortcuts.  

2. **Integrated Quiz System**  
   - Dynamically generates quizzes by grade, topic, and difficulty.  
   - Auto-grades responses and provides detailed explanations.  

3. **Parent & Educator Dashboards**  
   - Tracks progress, highlights strengths/weaknesses.  
   - Builds trust that EduMate is *teaching*, not *cheating*.  

4. **Answer Quality Assurance**  
   - All outputs undergo quality checks (accuracy, grade alignment).  
   - Incorrect answers trigger corrective hints and re-learning loops.

## 📊 Workflow Overview  

### 📌 Architecture Screenshot
*(Attach your flowchart as PNG)*  

![EduMate System Flow](flowchart.png)

The EduMate architecture follows a structured Orchestrated + RAG-enabled pipeline designed to support tutoring and quiz-based learning:

## User Input
A student, parent, or staff member interacts with the system (e.g., asks a question, requests a quiz).

## Orchestrator
The Orchestrator agent classifies the task:

- If it’s a help request or question, it routes to the Tutor Bot.  
- If it’s a quiz request or answer submission, it routes to the Quiz Module.

## RAG Pipeline
Both paths leverage the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for accuracy.

**Steps inside RAG:**
- **Embedding:** The query is embedded into vector form.  
- **ChromaDB Retrieval:** Relevant K–12 content (JSONL knowledge base) is fetched.  
- **LLM Processing:** An LLM uses the retrieved context to draft an answer.  
- **Answer Quality Checks:** The output is verified for factual correctness, grade-level suitability, and clarity.  

## Tutor Bot Path
- Provides step-by-step guidance, explanations, and hints instead of direct answers.  
- Uses LLM reinforcement for improving weak or unclear answers.  

## Quiz Path
- **Quiz Generation:** Creates adaptive questions based on topic, grade, and difficulty.  
- **Quiz Grader:** Evaluates student submissions, highlights correct/incorrect answers, and provides detailed explanations.  

## Feedback & Learning Loop
- **Correct answers** → reinforce progress and update student profile.  
- **Incorrect answers** → trigger corrective hints and explanations.  
- Parent/educator dashboards display weekly progress reports, quiz outcomes, and learning trends.  

## Output
- Students receive answers, quizzes, or reports.  
- Parents receive progress dashboards.  
- Educators receive tracking and grading support.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
**Frontend (React)**  
- Tutor view (grade slider + LaTeX rendering)  
- Quiz view (generate → answer → check → submit)  
- Parent Dashboard (progress & recommendations)

**Backend (FastAPI)**  
- `/ask` → RAG answer (Groq + ChromaDB)  
- `/quiz/generate` → AI-generated MCQs (JSON-only)  
- `/quiz/grade` → scoring + rationales  
- `/parent/*` → progress summaries & suggestions

**RAG Pipeline**  
1. **Embed** query with `SentenceTransformer`  
2. **Retrieve** top-k from **ChromaDB (DuckDB+Parquet persist)**  
3. **Compose** with Groq (`openai/gpt-oss-20b`) + **grade hint**  
4. **Return** Markdown + LaTeX (`$$...$$` blocks, `$...$` inline)

**Data**  
- `Attempt(student_id, item_id, selected, is_correct, ts)`  
- `QuizItem(id, topic, grade, skill_tag, choices{A..D}, correct)`  
- `SessionLog(student_id, minutes, date)`
